# GuessingGame

A simple `C#` console application. This game asks the user to pick a maximum number, then starts the game of guessing.

## How to play

> After choosing a maximum number, user will be prompted with:
> 

```bash
What number (between 1-X) am I thinking of?
```

As the player, simply **input a number** between the values and the console will tell you whether you need to aim **Higher or Lower.**

Once the target number has been guessed the console will output green text to let the user know they have completed the game. This will be displayed for 3 seconds before the window closes.

# CSGuess

This is a simple console application written in csharp that allows the user to play a number guessing game. The program generates a random target number between 1 and a user-defined maximum number. The user is then prompted to guess the number, and the program provides hints (higher or lower) based on the user's input until the correct number is guessed.

## How to Play

1. Run the application.
2. Set a maximum number when prompted.
3. Guess the number that the program is thinking of.
4. Receive hints (higher or lower) from the program.
5. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.
6. Enjoy the success message when you guess the number correctly!

## Example Usage

```
Set a maximum number:
100
What number (between 1-100) am I thinking of?

What number (between 1-100) am I thinking of?

What number (between 1-100) am I thinking of?
63
Higher.
What number (between 1-100) am I thinking of?
69

What number (between 1-100) am I thinking of?

You guessed it! I was thinking of 66
